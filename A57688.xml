            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

                  <p>THE States of <hi>Holland</hi> on Saturday last broke up their Assembly, and Their Highnesses the Prince and Princess of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range</hi> are departed hence, towards <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren,</hi> and from thence further, and so on to <hi>Breda,</hi> so that here is not any thing worthy of note. The Kings Yatch that is now in the Mase to attend Collonel <hi>Sidney</hi> the English Envoy, is to depart within 2 or 3 dayes. Our last Letters, make mention that His Majesty of Great <hi>Brittaine</hi> is happily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored to his former health, having had a fit of an Ague. This week The States do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend a final Resolution in reference to the Memorial lately delivered them by the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish Envoy,</hi> representing that the Barrier that was offered by the King of <hi>France</hi> was <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>w annihilated and void; As also to the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of the Prince of <hi>Luyck,</hi> so that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates and Differences concerning <hi>Hasselt</hi> and <hi>Maesyck</hi> may be drawn to some manner of Arbitration. The Papists at <hi>Basselduke</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a while ago committed some Insolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and made opposition against the Justice; so have the States given Order to the Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per-Schout of the same place, to proceed to Banishment of the Priest, and the same to prosecute according to the Ordinance of the Land, without the least Connivancy; And that the said Schout should confiscate the Popish-Church, and place the Atchievment of the Generality upon the Door; and give an account to the States what Ornaments were found in the said Church, with a strict charge to follow those proceedings already begun without any loss of time, against all those who had emboldned themselves to make a Collection for the Priest.</p>

                  <p>The dismal accident that befell the Pastor <hi>Mees</hi> on <hi>Ascension-day</hi> last we know has been amply discoursed, to wit, his being in great danger of being drowned, besides 5 other persons, which where all that were saved of 9, and that <hi>Melisdijck</hi> was the day following taken up, who was one of the 3 that were drowned; yet this we may present to the curious as new, that this Morning the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest Son of the aforesaid Minister is taken up near <hi>Delfs-haven,</hi> which 'tis probable might have been sooner taken up, as also his Daughter, had it not been such turbulent weather when they were lost. This Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is to be interred the Body of the Vice-Admiral <hi>Jan van Nes</hi> with great Solemnity, whose death is very much lamented here.</p>
